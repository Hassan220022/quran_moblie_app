# Theming and Navigation Update

## Summary of Changes

We have successfully fixed the theming consistency issues and created a comprehensive settings system integrated into the bottom navigation. Here's what was implemented:

## 🎨 **Fixed Theming Issues**

### Before:
- Bottom navigation bar used hardcoded colors that didn't respond properly to theme changes
- Inconsistent color schemes across different parts of the app
- Theme changes would affect some elements but not others

### After:
- **Material 3 Compliant**: All UI elements now use the proper Material 3 ColorScheme system
- **Consistent Theming**: Bottom navigation, app bar, and all UI elements respond consistently to theme changes
- **Enhanced Theme Provider Integration**: Properly integrated with our comprehensive theme system
- **Smooth Transitions**: Theme changes now apply seamlessly across all components
